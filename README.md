# react-typescript--rxjs
A fork of [vue-typescript--rxjs](https://github.com/orenhd/vue-typescript--rxjs), demonstrating a conversion of the boilerplate codebase from Vue.js to React, while still utilizing Typescript, RxJS and material design components.

A live version of this repository can be found [here](https://orenhd.github.io/react-typescript--rxjs/) (Dev mode).

## Notable Changes
- Implemented [react-intl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-intl) for localization support.
- Using [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com) for Material components implementation.
- Rewrote the homebrew ClickOutside vue directive as an higher order addon function, returning a document click handler for click outside events.
